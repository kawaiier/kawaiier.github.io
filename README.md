## About Me
Hi! My name is Sergey.
I'm Tbilisi based web and game developer.
I've been creating games since 2018 and webapps/webpages since late 2019.
I got skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C# and Python.
Most of my web projects are in Russian but games are in English. 

## Apps
Both apps are in Russian. _Translation in progress‚Ä¶_
